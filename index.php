<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is MacKenzie Kimball. I currently work as a Web Editor at <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/" target="blank">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a> here in Boston. I have been in publishing for eight years, mainly on the editorial side of the business. I moved over to the digital side a few years ago with creating and managing blogs, enewsletters, and elearning courses. I am originally from Massachusetts and currently live in South Boston. I went to school at the University of Vermont and graduated with a double degree in English and Psychology.</p>
<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
<p>Last May, my web developer left the organization. So I taught myself HTML and a little CSS and took over maintenance of the site. In doing so, I quickly discovered that I really enjoy coding and would like to expand my knowledge in the area.</p>
<p>This is my second course in Information Technology at Harvard Extension School. Last semester I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and a little PHP, Java, and jQuery. I am enrolled in this class to expand my coding knowledge and take the next step in learning how to develop web applications and dynamic websites. I am working on getting a Certificate in Web Technologies and potentially proceeding on to a Masters in IT. I am really looking forward to learning as much as possible from this course!</p>
<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
<p>I have an intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS and a beginners knowledge of PHP, Java, and jQuery. But I am a fast an eager learner, so I am confident this course really expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
<p>I am working on a Mac.</p>
<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
<p>In addition to my day job at Dana-Farber, I am also interning with an event planning company. Last semester I created a very rudimentary website for my potential party planning company. I am interested in exploring ways to enhance that website and make it more dynamic. I also have an idea for a dynamic web application for a non-profit my father volunteers with, Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly. I hope to explore these ideas a little further in this class.</p>
